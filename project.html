                    This is my first time ever writing something like this. Somewhere back in October of 2022. I started an FPS project in Unity.
                    I've been working on it in my free time, although that is on hold for now since I'm still job hunting. I still have no idea
                    what path the project should take. I do have some ideas about the game's mechanics, but as far as the story and the style of the
                    game goes, that's still a work in progress.
                    <br><br>
                    I'll try to showcase what I have done so far, and I'll try my best to keep this "blog" updated on anything I do further.

                    This is the devlog I uploaded last year in November. I mostly showcased the FPS controller and shooting mechanics. The FPS controller's
                    code was mostly borrowed from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@comp3interactive">Comp-3 Interactive's</a> lengthy FPS controller series.
                    A lot of it will mostly change as the development goes along, and as ideas for the game change.
                    <br><br>
                    However, I tried making my own shooting controller. In the beginning it was pretty buggy, the recoil system made bullets go 
                    all over the place, the ammo wouldn't be subtracted correctly, there were problems with animations not playing properly, etc. Moving on 
                    from working on casual 2D games for Android in a professional environment, to working on a 3D FPS shooter was not an easy transition,
                     but it has certainly been a really good learning experience. I have learned a lot about rigid bodies, raycasting, animation and the 3D environment 
                     in general.
